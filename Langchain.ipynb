            "\n",
            "1. A/B testing: LangSmith allows users to create multiple versions of their applications with different identifiers and view their performance side-by-side, making it easier to test changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.\n",
            "2. Automations: LangSmith's automation feature enables users to perform actions on traces in near real-time, such as automatically scoring traces, sending them to annotation queues, or sending them to datasets.\n",
            "3. Annotating interesting traces: LangSmith allows users to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria, which helps catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.\n",
            "4. Adding runs to a dataset: LangSmith enables users to add runs as examples to datasets, which helps refine and improve the application's performance during the beta testing phase.\n",
            "5. Capturing feedback: LangSmith allows users to gather human feedback on the responses produced by their application, which helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses.\n",
            "6. Initial test set: LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on their LLM applications."
